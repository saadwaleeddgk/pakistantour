        <h1>Neza Bazi</h1>
        <p>
          Neza Bazi, also known as tent pegging, is a traditional equestrian
          sport popular in South Asia, including Punjab. It involves riders on
          horseback aiming to pick up small objects, usually wooden pegs, from
          the ground using a lance or spear while galloping at full speed. This
          thrilling and skillful sport has its roots in military training and
          has evolved into a competitive and entertaining spectacle.
          Participants in Neza Bazi showcase their horsemanship, agility, and
          precision as they maneuver their horses at high speeds to spear the
          targets. The sport requires not only physical prowess but also a
          strong bond between the rider and the horse, as they work together in
          perfect harmony to achieve victory. Neza Bazi events attract large
          crowds, with spectators cheering on their favorite riders and admiring
          the grace and athleticism of the horses. It is not only a test of
          skill but also a celebration of Punjab's rich equestrian heritage and
          cultural traditions.
