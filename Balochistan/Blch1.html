        <h1>Balochi Dress</h1>
        <p>
          The Balochi dress, a traditional attire worn by the Baloch people
          primarily in the Balochistan region spanning across Iran, Pakistan,
          and Afghanistan, is a vibrant reflection of their culture, heritage,
          and identity. Typically, the Balochi dress consists of loose, flowing
          garments suitable for the region's hot and arid climate. For men, the
          traditional Balochi attire includes a long shirt known as "shirwani"
          or "jamag," paired with loose-fitting trousers called "shalwar." The
          shalwar often features intricate embroidery or embellishments along
          the cuffs. Additionally, men may wear a vest known as "jabbet" over
          the shirt, and a turban or a traditional Balochi cap completes the
          ensemble. Women's Balochi dress typically comprises a long,
          loose-fitting tunic called "froak" or "firaq," often adorned with
          vibrant embroidery, mirror work, and intricate patterns. This tunic is
          paired with wide-legged trousers called "pirahan," and a matching
          scarf or shawl completes the outfit. The Balochi dress for women is
          known for its vivid colors and detailed craftsmanship, reflecting the
          region's rich artistic traditions. Furthermore, both men and women
          often accessorize their attire with traditional Balochi jewelry, such
          as elaborate necklaces, earrings, and bangles, adding further elegance
          and cultural significance to their dress. Overall, the Balochi dress
          serves not only as a form of clothing but also as a symbol of cultural
          pride and heritage for the Baloch people, showcasing their unique
          traditions and craftsmanship.
