        <h1>Chatti di Lassi</h1>
        <p>
          Chatti di Lassi, or traditional Punjabi lassi served in earthenware
          pots, is a refreshing and nourishing beverage enjoyed by people of all
          ages across Punjab. Made from creamy yogurt, sugar, and flavored with
          cardamom or rose water, lassi is a cooling antidote to the sweltering
          heat of summer. The use of earthenware pots, known as chatti, to serve
          lassi is not just a matter of tradition but also adds a unique earthy
          flavor to the drink. The porous nature of the clay helps keep the
          lassi cool and enhances its taste, making it even more delightful to
          savor. Chatti di Lassi is not only a delicious thirst-quencher but
          also offers numerous health benefits. Rich in probiotics and
          nutrients, lassi aids in digestion, boosts immunity, and provides a
          natural source of hydration, making it a popular choice during hot
          summer days.
