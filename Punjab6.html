        <h1>Punjabi Culture</h1>
        <p>
          Punjab, often referred to as the "Land of Five Rivers," boasts a rich
          and vibrant culture that is deeply rooted in tradition yet dynamic and
          ever-evolving. Punjabi culture is characterized by its warm
          hospitality, zest for life, and love for music, dance, and festivals.
          One of the defining aspects of Punjabi culture is its cuisine,
          renowned for its rich flavors and aromatic spices. Punjabi dishes like
          sarson da saag, makki di roti, butter chicken, and lassi have gained
          popularity worldwide, tantalizing taste buds with their delicious
          flavors and hearty portions. Music and dance are integral parts of
          Punjabi culture, with bhangra, giddha, and Punjabi folk music
          embodying the spirit and vitality of the region. These art forms serve
          as expressions of joy, celebration, and solidarity, bringing
          communities together in moments of happiness and camaraderie.
          Hospitality is a cherished value in Punjabi culture, with guests often
          being treated with utmost respect and generosity. It is not uncommon
          for Punjabi households to welcome visitors with a lavish spread of
          food and warm hospitality, ensuring that no one leaves empty-handed or
          unsatisfied. Religion also plays a significant role in Punjabi
          culture, with Sikhism being the predominant faith. The Golden Temple
          in Amritsar, a sacred site for Sikhs, stands as a symbol of spiritual
          devotion and communal harmony, attracting millions of pilgrims and
          tourists from around the world.
