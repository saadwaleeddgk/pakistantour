        <h1>Gilgiti Dress</h1>
        <p>
          The traditional dress of Gilgit reflects the region's diverse cultural
          tapestry, influenced by its geographical location and the ethnic
          composition of its inhabitants. Each ethnic group in Gilgit, including
          the Shina, Burusho, Wakhi, and Balti, has its distinctive attire,
          showcasing vibrant colors, intricate designs, and unique
          craftsmanship. For men, traditional attire often consists of
          loose-fitting garments designed to provide comfort and mobility in the
          mountainous terrain. This includes the "Shalwar Kameez," a long tunic
          paired with loose trousers, often adorned with embroidery or
          embellishments. In colder weather, men may also wear a "Chapan," a
          long, thick coat made of wool or fur, providing warmth and protection
          from the elements. Women's traditional attire in Gilgit is
          characterized by colorful dresses and intricate embroidery, reflecting
          the region's rich cultural heritage. The "Pheran" is a traditional
          dress worn by women, consisting of a long, loose-fitting robe often
          adorned with vibrant patterns and embroidery. Women also wear "Shalwar
          Kameez," similar to men's attire but with more embellishments and
          variations in design. Accessories play a significant role in Gilgit's
          traditional dress, with men and women adorning themselves with
          jewelry, scarves, and caps. Handcrafted jewelry made of silver,
          turquoise, and other semi-precious stones is popular among both
          genders, adding a touch of elegance to their attire. While modern
          clothing styles have become more prevalent in urban centers,
          traditional dress continues to be worn during cultural events,
          festivals, and special occasions, serving as a symbol of identity and
          pride for the people of Gilgit.
