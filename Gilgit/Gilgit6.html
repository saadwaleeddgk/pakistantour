          Kharmang Shigar Polo is a traditional sport played in the picturesque
          valleys of Gilgit-Baltistan, Pakistan, where polo holds special
          significance as a cultural tradition and a symbol of strength, skill,

          roots in the cultural heritage of Gilgit-Baltistan and is considered
          one of the oldest team sports in the world. Played on horseback with
          long-handled mallets and a small ball, polo requires speed, agility,

          occasion, bringing communities together and fostering a sense of unity
          and pride. Spectators gather to cheer on their favorite teams, enjoy
          traditional music and dance performances, and savor local delicacies
          amidst the stunning mountain vistas of the Kharmang and Shigar
          valleys. The Kharmang Shigar Polo tournament embodies the spirit of
          Gilgit-Baltistan, celebrating the region's rich cultural heritage,
          love of sport, and reverence for nature. It is a testament to the
          resilience, camaraderie, and indomitable spirit of the people who call
          this majestic land home
