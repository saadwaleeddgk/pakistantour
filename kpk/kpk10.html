        <h1>Sir Cunningham Clock Tower</h1>
        <p>
          The Sir Cunningham Clock Tower is a historic landmark located in the
          heart of Peshawar, the capital city of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK),
          Pakistan. Named after Sir George Cunningham, the British Governor of
          the North-West Frontier Province in the early 20th century, the clock
          tower stands as a symbol of colonial heritage and architectural
          grandeur. Built-in 1900 to commemorate Queen Victoria's Diamond
          Jubilee, the clock tower is an imposing structure that dominates the
          city skyline, rising to a height of 26 meters (85 feet). It features a
          blend of Victorian and Mughal architectural styles, with intricate
          carvings, arched windows, and a distinctive clock face adorned with
          Roman numerals. The Sir Cunningham Clock Tower has witnessed
          significant events in Peshawar's history, from colonial rule to
          independence, and remains a beloved symbol of the city's cultural
          identity and heritage. It serves as a gathering point for locals and
          visitors alike, who come to admire its beauty, take photographs, and
          soak in the ambiance of the surrounding bustling bazaars and bustling
          streets.
