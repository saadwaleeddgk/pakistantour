        <h1>Peshawari Khawa</h1>
        <p>
          Peshawari Khawa, also known as "Peshawari Green Tea," is a traditional
          beverage enjoyed by the people of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK), Pakistan.
          It is known for its robust flavor, earthy aroma, and invigorating
          qualities, making it a popular choice for social gatherings,
          hospitality, and relaxation. Peshawari Khawa is made by brewing green
          tea leaves with a blend of aromatic spices such as cardamom, cloves,
          cinnamon, and ginger. The tea is simmered over low heat to extract the
          flavors and then sweetened with sugar or honey to taste. The resulting
          brew is a fragrant and flavorful concoction that warms the body and
          delights the senses. Khawa is more than just a beverage; it is a
          cultural tradition and a symbol of hospitality and friendship in KPK.
          It is often served to guests as a gesture of welcome and goodwill,
          accompanied by traditional snacks like nuts, dried fruits, and sweets.
          Whether enjoyed in the bustling bazaars of Peshawar or the serene tea
          gardens of the countryside, Peshawari Khawa brings people together,
          fosters conversation, and creates moments of warmth and connection in
          the chilly mountain air.
