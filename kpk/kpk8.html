        <h1>Peshawari Palao</h1>
        <p>
          Peshawari Palao, also known as "Peshawari Pulao," is a classic rice
          dish originating from the city of Peshawar in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa
          (KPK), Pakistan. It is renowned for its rich flavors, aromatic spices,
          and tender meat, making it a beloved staple of Pakistani cuisine. The
          key ingredients of Peshawari Palao include basmati rice, meat (usually
          lamb, chicken, or beef), onions, tomatoes, yogurt, and a blend of
          spices such as cumin, coriander, cardamom, cloves, and cinnamon. The
          rice is cooked with the meat and spices until tender, absorbing the
          flavors and aromas to create a fragrant and flavorful dish. Peshawari
          Palao is often garnished with fried onions, almonds, and raisins,
          adding a touch of sweetness and crunch to the dish. It is typically
          served with raita (yogurt sauce), salad, and chutney, creating a
          balanced and satisfying meal. The dish is a favorite choice for
          special occasions, festivals, and gatherings, where it is served with
          generous hospitality and shared among friends and family. Its hearty
          flavors and comforting warmth make Peshawari Palao a culinary treasure
          cherished by all who taste it.
