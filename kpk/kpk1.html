        <h1>KPK Dresses</h1>
        <p>
          Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) dresses reflect the region's diverse cultural
          heritage and the traditional attire worn by its inhabitants. Men
          typically wear the "Shalwar Kameez," consisting of loose-fitting
          trousers paired with a long tunic-like shirt. The kameez may be
          adorned with intricate embroidery or embellishments, depending on the
          occasion and personal style. Women in KPK often wear the "Firaq," a
          two-piece ensemble comprising a long shirt and matching trousers or
          skirt. The Firaq is known for its vibrant colors, geometric patterns,
          and delicate embroidery, which vary from region to region and tribe to
          tribe. Accessories play a significant role in KPK attire, with men
          often donning turbans, vests, and waistcoats, while women accessorize
          with jewelry, scarves, and shawls. The traditional attire reflects the
          region's cultural values, identity, and sense of pride, passed down
          through generations with reverence and respect.
