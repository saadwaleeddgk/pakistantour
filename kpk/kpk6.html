        <h1>Peshawari Cap</h1>
        <p>
          The Peshawari Cap, also known as the "Karakul Cap" or "Chitrali Topi,"
          is a traditional headwear style originating from the Khyber
          Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) province of Pakistan. It is worn by men as a symbol
          of cultural identity and pride, reflecting the region's rich heritage
          and traditions. The Peshawari Cap is typically made from felted wool
          or sheepskin, with a distinctive round shape and a flat crown. It is
          often adorned with decorative elements such as embroidery, tassels, or
          buttons, adding to its aesthetic appeal and elegance. The cap is an
          integral part of traditional attire in KPK, worn on special occasions,
          religious ceremonies, and cultural festivals. It is also a popular
          souvenir for visitors to the region, symbolizing the warmth,
          hospitality, and authenticity of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. In addition to
          its cultural significance, the Peshawari Cap also serves practical
          purposes, providing protection from the sun, wind, and cold weather.
          Its sturdy construction and timeless design make it a versatile
          accessory for men of all ages and walks of life in KPK and beyond.
