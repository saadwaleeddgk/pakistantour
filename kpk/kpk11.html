        <h1>Jirga</h1>
        <p>
          Jirga is a traditional system of conflict resolution and governance
          practiced in the tribal regions of Pakistan, including Khyber
          Pakhtunkhwa (KPK), Balochistan, and the Federally Administered Tribal
          Areas (FATA). Rooted in Pashtunwali, the ancient code of conduct of
          the Pashtun people, Jirga embodies principles of justice, equality,
          and consensus-building. A Jirga typically consists of respected elders
          and leaders from the community who come together to resolve disputes,
          settle grievances, and make decisions on matters of social, legal, and
          political importance. The proceedings are conducted in an informal
          setting, often under a tree or in a communal gathering space, where
          participants engage in dialogue, negotiation, and mediation to reach a
          consensus. Jirga decisions are binding and enforceable, reflecting the
          collective wisdom and authority of the community. They are based on
          principles of fairness, impartiality, and mutual respect, with an
          emphasis on preserving harmony and restoring peace within the
          community. In addition to conflict resolution, Jirga plays a vital
          role in governance, with tribal leaders and elders serving as
          mediators, advisors, and representatives of their communities in
          matters of law, administration, and justice. Despite modernization and
          legal reforms, Jirga continues to be a central institution in many
          tribal societies, embodying the resilience, autonomy, and cultural
          identity of the Pashtun people
