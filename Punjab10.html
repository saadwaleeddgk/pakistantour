        <h1>Dancing Horse</h1>
        <p>
          The dancing horse, also known as "Bhangra Horse," is a captivating
          sight often seen at festivals, weddings, and cultural events in
          Punjab. Adorned with colorful decorations, bells, and tassels, the
          horse performs rhythmic dance movements in response to the beats of
          traditional Punjabi music. Trained by skilled handlers, the dancing
          horse gracefully moves its legs in time with the music, creating a
          mesmerizing spectacle that delights audiences of all ages. The
          performance symbolizes the vibrant spirit and joyous energy of
          Punjab's cultural heritage. The tradition of dancing horses dates back
          centuries and is deeply rooted in Punjabi folklore and mythology.
          Horses have long been revered as symbols of strength, grace, and
          nobility in Punjabi culture, and their inclusion in festive
          celebrations adds a touch of grandeur and splendor. The dancing horse
          is not merely a performer but also a symbol of pride and tradition,
          representing the rich cultural tapestry of Punjab and the enduring
          bond between humans and animals.
