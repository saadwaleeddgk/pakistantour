        <h1>Desi Nashta</h1>
        <p>
          Desi Nashta, or traditional Punjabi breakfast, is a hearty and
          flavorful meal that kick-starts the day with a burst of energy and
          taste. It typically includes a variety of savory and sweet dishes,
          each showcasing the rich culinary heritage of Punjab. A typical Desi
          Nashta spread may consist of parathas (flaky flatbreads) served with
          butter, ghee, or homemade preserves like mango or mixed fruit.
          Accompanying the parathas are an array of side dishes such as spicy
          omelets, creamy yogurt, pickles, and fresh seasonal fruits. One of the
          highlights of Desi Nashta is the aromatic and invigorating chai (tea),
          brewed with spices like cardamom, cloves, and cinnamon, and served
          piping hot in clay cups. The chai provides a comforting and
          rejuvenating start to the day, warming both body and soul. Desi Nashta
          is more than just a meal; it is a cherished culinary tradition that
          brings families together and fosters a sense of camaraderie and
          connection. Whether enjoyed leisurely at home or savored at roadside
          dhabas (eateries), Desi Nashta embodies the essence of Punjab's rich
          gastronomic heritage.
