        <h1>Punjabi Dress</h1>
        <p>
          Punjabi dress reflects the rich cultural heritage and vibrant spirit
          of Punjab. Traditional attire for men includes the kurta, a long
          tunic-like shirt, paired with loose-fitting pants known as pajama or
          dhoti, along with a colorful turban or pagri. Women often adorn
          themselves in the vibrant and elegant salwar kameez, consisting of a
          long tunic top paired with loose-fitting pants and a matching scarf or
          dupatta. The intricate embroidery, vibrant colors, and luxurious
          fabrics used in Punjabi dress exemplify the region's artistic
          craftsmanship and love for beauty. Each garment is meticulously
          crafted, with embroidery patterns inspired by nature, mythology, and
          cultural motifs, making Punjabi attire a feast for the eyes. The
          turban, or pagri, worn by Punjabi men holds cultural significance,
          symbolizing honor, respect, and valor. It is not just a piece of cloth
          but a representation of identity and pride, with different styles and
          colors denoting various social and religious affiliations. Punjabi
          dress is not limited to special occasions but is also worn in everyday
          life, reflecting the region's rich cultural heritage and sense of
          tradition. Whether it's a festive celebration, a wedding ceremony, or
          a casual gathering, Punjabi attire adds a touch of elegance and grace
          to any occasion.
