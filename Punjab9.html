        <h1>Bear & Dog Fight</h1>
        <p>
          Bear and dog fights, although once prevalent in certain regions, are
          now considered illegal and inhumane in many parts of the world,
          including Punjab. These barbaric spectacles involved pitting trained
          dogs against bears in brutal fights for entertainment and gambling
          purposes. In such fights, the dogs, often trained specifically for
          combat, would be unleashed upon the tethered bear, resulting in a
          violent and bloody struggle. These fights were not only cruel to the
          animals involved but also reflected a dark side of human entertainment
          and exploitation. Thankfully, awareness campaigns and strict
          enforcement of animal welfare laws have led to the decline and
          eventual prohibition of bear and dog fights in Punjab and elsewhere.
          Efforts are now focused on promoting humane forms of entertainment and
          fostering compassion towards animals.
